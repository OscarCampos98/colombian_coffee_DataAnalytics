## Project Overview

This project analyzes data gathered from the Juan Valdez website, where Tableau Prep was used to clean the data, and Tableau was used to create the visualizations. The focus is on understanding coffee production trends, technological advancements in cultivation, and the global market dynamics that shape Colombia's coffee industry.

### Key Questions Explored:

- **Huila’s Impact:** How has Huila’s pioneering role in coffee production influenced the broader Colombian coffee narrative?
- **Technological Influence:** What impact have technological advancements had on coffee cultivation in Huila and Colombia?
- **Price Trends:** How have coffee prices evolved over the years, and what do they reveal about Colombia’s coffee market?
- **Export Destinations:** What are the primary export destinations for Colombian coffee, and how have these preferences changed?
- **Clustering Analysis:** Can clustering algorithms uncover distinctive trends in export data based on volume, value, and destination?

## Tools & Technologies Used:

- **Tableau and Tableau Prep:** Used for cleaning the data and creating visualizations.
- **Google Colab:** A central hub for data analysis, employing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **K-means Clustering:** Used to identify trends in Colombian coffee export data.

## Data Sources

- **Dataset 1:** Production, Area, and Pricing Dynamics (July 2022)
  - Internal pricing (Almacafé)
  - External pricing (Almacafé)
  - ICO Indicative Prices
  - Cultivation area and techniques (SICA FNC)
  - Production volume (FNC)
  
- **Dataset 2:** Export Data by Destination (November 2022)
  - Export volume and value
  - Primary export destinations

## Insights from the Analysis

- **Huila’s Coffee Legacy:** A significant contributor to Colombia’s coffee production, Huila overtook Antioquia as the top producer in 2011. This region benefits from two harvest periods each year, making it unique in Colombia’s coffee landscape.
- **Technological Advancements:** The shift toward “Young Technified” cultivation methods has positively impacted production and harvest values, as modern agricultural techniques enhance efficiency and yield.
- **Price Trends:** Coffee prices have shown volatility due to global events like overproduction and the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Colombian coffee market has remained resilient with a positive CAGR of 3.67% from 2000 to 2021.
- **Export Destinations:** The United States, Japan, Germany, Belgium, and Canada are Colombia's top export destinations, with the U.S. accounting for 42.35% of total exports.
